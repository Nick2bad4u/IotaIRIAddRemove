# IotaIRIAddRemove
A script made for iota IRI to add and remove neighbors with one simple command!!t

The script will do the following:

Stops Nelson via PM2

Add via the API

Add to the config

Lets you Verify the config

Restarts Nelson via PM2


For this to work correctly you need to change the location of `"/home/iota/node/iota.ini"` to the location of your IRI config.

Thanks!
